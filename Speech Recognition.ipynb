    "## Speech recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "This week’s assignment is a simplified form of speech recognition. The languages are artificial and have been generated using a combination of Markov models and hidden Markov models (HMMs). In real life things are much more messy! This artificial data makes for a better tutorial with cleaner results. There are two forms of the datasets available. In the first form, there are several audio files, which can be parsed into discrete phonemes. In the second form, the parsing has already been done for you, and you are presented with long sequences of symbols. It is worth listening to the audio yourself, and seeing if you can determine any differences between the “languages” or “speakers” by ear! If you want to process the audio dataset, then it is advised to use: scipy.io.wavfile to read an audio file. All audio will be single channel (mono) and noiselessly generated from a small set of component sounds."

    "### 2 - Speaker identification\n",
    "There are three people in a room. Each says about 10 phonemes, before being randomly interrupted by someone else. When they speak they all sound the same, however each person tends to use different phonemes in their speech. Specifically we can model the following transition probabilities that someone will interrupt the current speaker: P(speaker i at time t+1 | speaker j at time t). We can also model the probability over phonemes given a particular speaker: P(phoneme | speaker i). The phonemes are identical to the ones introduced in problem 1 (but the transition matrices are obviously different, since they take a different form altogether).\n",
